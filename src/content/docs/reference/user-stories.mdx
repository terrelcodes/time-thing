## As a user, I expect to log in and see a dashboard with content specific to my role.

The dashboard shows a list of active projects with their status.
I only see tasks that belong to my team.

I can click on a task to see its details and start working on it. 

I can assign myself to a task if it is not already assigned.

I can click a button to edit my profile.

I can click a button to log out.




## As a user, I want to be able to track the time I spend on projects.

A time entry is a record of the time I spend on a task.
It has an owner—the person who did the work.
It is associated with a task.
It includes a start time, an end time, and a (calculated) duration.
It is associated with an activity (type of work/tag/label).
It should include editable note (body).

The body of a time entry can be edited.
It serves as a journal entry like a commit message.
It is formatted with Markdown.
It can include links to external resources.
It can include attachments.


## When a user logs in, they see a dashboard.
The dashboard shows a list of active projects with their status.
The status is a combination of important features:
* project name
* owner
* overall health and progress
* recent activity
* important notifications (messsages from other users)
* warnings of potential issues, e.g. tasks that are behind schedule/over budget/overdue/not being worked on

Clicking on a project card shows the project details page.

The project detail page shows:
* short description of the project
* summary statistics for all time and for the current sprint
* progress and health of the project
* a list of tasks and sub-projects, represented as cards in columns of a kanban board.
The tasks/sub-projects are in one of the following states (i.e. columns of the kanban board):
* Not Started
* Ready
* In Progress
* Done
* Blocked
* On Hold
* Cancelled

Tasks that are behind schedule or overdue or otherwise problematic are highlighted.
Each task card has:
* the name of the task
* an avatar with the name of the last person who worked on the task
* the progress based on sum of time entries vs. estimated duration
* a button that shows more details in place (summary view of last 3 time entries)
* a button to go to a detail/edit page.
* a button to add a new time entry (i.e. start working on the task) or to end an active time entry (i.e. stop working on the task).
* an icon showing unread notifications with the number of such. Clicking on it shows a list of notifications.




## As a user, I want to manage a list of projects.
A project is a bundle of work. It consists of tasks and sub-projects.
Projects can be nested. A task can be promoted to a project.

A project can be instantiated from a template. A template is a project that can be used as a starting point for a new project. It usually contains a list of tasks that are common to many projects. I need to be able to create a new project from a template. I need to be able to turn a project into a template (but not back). Turning a project into a template should not affect the project it was turned from, but any time entries in the project will NOT be included in the template.

## As a user, I want to be able to add a new project.
A project has a parent project, a name, a description, a start date, and an end date.
Start and end date are optional.
Top-level projects are children of the root project.
A project can be active or inactive.
An active project is one that is currently being worked on.
An inactive project is one that is no longer being worked on.
An inactive project can be reactivated.
An inactive project can be archived.


## As a user, I want to be able to edit a project.
## As a user, I want to be able to archive a project.

## As a user, I want to manage a list of tasks.
A task is a unit of work that I can track the time I spend on.
A task has a name, a description, and an estimated duration.
It may have a list of dependencies—tasks that must be completed before it can be started.
A task can be split into two tasks—a part that is already done and a part that is not yet done.
The estimated duration of a task can be changed. These changes are tracked: who made the change, when it was made, the justification for the change, and the new estimated duration.




## As a user, I want to be able to refer to activities by name.
An activity is a named thing that categorizes the time I spend. 
Activities are created dynamically by referring to them by name. 
Examples include: 

* reading documentation
* writing documentation
* writing code
* debugging code
* testing code
* refactoring code
* writing tests
* sleeping
* taking a break
* communicating
* planning
* meeting
