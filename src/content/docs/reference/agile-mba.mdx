If I can direct your attention, I can predict what decisions you are going to make.

this is literally true with LLMs.

See differently — think differently — do differently.

Notice what you are paying attention to. 

we get better at what we pay attention to. intentional practice < attentional practice.
e.g. practicing the violin while distracted is less effective than practicing the violin while focused.
pay attention to surprises.
 If something is surprising, ask why.
 
 Agile is a way for groups to work together effectively.

Continually changing what you focus on slows you down.

You can't do everything.
You can't do everything well.
You can't do everything well at the same time.
You can't do everything well at the same time with the same level of quality.
You can't do everything well at the same time with the same level of quality with the same level of speed.
You can't do everything well at the same time with the same level of quality with the same level of speed with the same level of accuracy.

Why do companies ask us to do things in a certain way?

* I don't know any better.
* I don't want to learn a new way.

- Decide
- Act

The smaller the loop, the faster the reaction time.
