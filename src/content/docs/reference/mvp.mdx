description: The minimum viable product

The MVP is a simple time tracking system that allows users to track their time spent on tasks.
(This could be as simple as a Tier 1 project.)

## Features

- [ ] CRUD for Projects (Projects are collections of Tasks and Sub-Projects)
- [ ] CRUD for Tasks (Tasks are leaf nodes in the hierarchy)
- [ ] CRUD for WorkEntries (WorkEntries are the basic unit of work)

## Data model

* User -- created by the system when the user signs up. Separate from but used by authentication system.
    * id
    * username (string) (unique, not null)
    * display_name (string) (nullable)
    * email (string) (unique, not null)
    * avatar (string) (nullable)

* Task
    * id
    * owner_id (FK to User.id) (not null)
    * parent_id (FK to Task.id) (null if it is a top-level task)
    * is_project (boolean) (not null, default false)
    * is_pinned (boolean) (not null, default false)
    * name (string) (not null)
    * description (string) (nullable)
    * start_date (date) (nullable) -- if null, this is set by the system when the first work entry is created.
    * end_date (date) (nullable) -- if null, this is set by the system when task is marked as completed.
    * due_date (date) (nullable) 
    * estimated_time (integer) (nullable) 
    * status (enum "new", "in_progress", "blocked", "completed", "cancelled") (not null, default "new")

* WorkEntry
    * id
    * owner_id (FK to User.id) (not null)
    * task_id (FK to Task.id) (not null) -- can be changed by the user.
    * start_time (unix UTC timestamp in seconds) (not null) -- set by the system when the work entry is created.
    * end_time (unix UTC timestamp in seconds) (nullable) -- set by the user any time before end_time is set.
    * description (string) (nullable) -- cannot be null if end_time is set.
    * duration (integer) (nullable) -- time in seconds set by the system when end_time is set.

## Default data

When a user signs up, a new top-level (root) project is created for them.
This project name is "\{user.display_name\}'s Work" or "My Work" if `display_name` is not set.
It contains the following Tasks:

- "Read Onboarding Tutorial"
- "Manage projects and tasks"

## UI

The UI should be simple and easy to use.

The header bar includes any active WorkEntries. There should normally be only one. This is a quick way to see what the user is working on. `<Task/WorkEntry Name> <Elapsed Time> <Start/Stop>`

The main view is a list of tasks and projects. (the root project)

Pinned tasks should appear first.
A task is "Focused" if it has a due date within the next 5 days or work entries in the previous 3 days and is not completed. Focused tasks are placed after pinned tasks.
Pinned projects come next.
Unfocused and unpinned projects and tasks follow.

In this view, projects are collapsed by default. (except for the root project)

There should be no reason to paginate: use infinite scroll (not in the MVP). 

Clicking on a project should open a new tab showing only that project's contents.
Clicking on a task should open a new tab showing that task's details, including a list of work entries.

On wide-enough screens, the main view should be split into two columns:
- The narrow left column is the list of tasks and projects (the root project).
- The wide right column is the details of the selected task or project.

The wide right column should be split into two rows:
- The top row is the details of the selected task or project.
- The bottom row is a list of the Project's children or the Task's work entries.

## Documentation
The MVP must include an onboarding tutorial that explains the essential features of the system and demonstrates how to use them. The tutorial must be accessible from the docs menu.


## Notes to self

Before you decide to allow converting a task to a project, consider what to do with the work entries associated with the task.

Stretch goal: MVP should allow moving tasks and projects between projects, and assigning work entries to different tasks. This UI should be simple and easy to use—drag and drop can wait.

Byte the bullet and use Convex. It's a good fit for this project.

## Solo Project

Tier 0: 
- create a SolidJS To Do app (SPA with local storage).
- create a FastAPI CRUD API. 
- modify the SolidJS app to use the API.
- figure out deployment of Python+TypeScript apps (CORS, XSRF, auth, etc.).
- rewrite the backend in TypeScript, retaining the use of fetch. Demonstrate how this simplifies deployment to Vercel. Reference Theo's videos on the advantages of Serverless.
- use TRPC instead of fetch.
- use Convex instead of TRPC + traditonal database.

Create a video comparing the different approaches.

Yeah, this is a lot of work—more than 20 hours—But: 

* it's a good way to learn
* it will be a good reference for future projects.
* it will be a good reference for future videos.
* it will enlighten the Chingu community.
