I want to track time. 

## WorkEntry
The basic unit of work is a `WorkEntry` (a record in the `Work` table), which consists of

* a description 
    * this freeform markdown entry serves the same purpose as a commit message
    * the first line is the title of the time entry
    * it can be edited
    * it can be null until the time entry is finished (i.e. the end time is set)
    * hashtags are used to add labels/tags
* an owner (person who does the work, not null)
* a start time (not null)
* an end time (null if the time entry is still active)
* a task (not null)

## Task

A task is a larger unit of work—a container for work entries. It includes 

* a title, 
* a description, 
* an owner (assigned person),
* an estimated time (hours), 
* a status (new, in-progress, complete, canceled, paused, blocked),
* a start date, (*may* be null if the task is not started yet)
* an end date, (null if the task is not finished yet)
* a due date, (may be null)
* a parent project

## Labels/Tags

A task or time entry can have zero or more labels/tags. In the UI, these can be added with hashtags in the description, or as a separate field. The database might store them as a list of strings or a many-to-many relationship.

## Project

A project is a container for tasks and sub-projects. It includes 
* a title, 
* a description, 
* an owner, 
* a time budget (maximum hours allowed), 
* a start date, (may be null if the project is not started yet)
* an end date, (null if the project is not finished yet)
* a due date, (may be null)
* a status (new, in-progress, complete, canceled, paused, blocked)
* a parent project (null if it is a top-level project)

## Dependencies

A task or project can depend on other tasks/projects—it cannot start until those are complete.
This is a many-to-many relationship.

How is a Project related to a Task? Is a Project just a task with more metadata? Does it make sense in this context for a task to have sub-tasks, or is that the distinction: a Task is a leaf node in the hierarchy, and a Project is a container? Can something be stubbed as a task, and then later be expanded into a project?

All of the fields are the same for a Task and a Project. A minor difference is that a Project has a time budget, and a Task has an estimated time—that is only a difference in interpretation. A Project is a container for tasks, and a Task is a container for time entries (work).

A Project has additional documentation, such as a charter, a plan, a roadmap, and associated stakeholders, but these are not needed for tracking time. Stakeholders are needed only for the communication system, which is separate from time tracking.

Maybe we can add a "type" field to the "Workables" table, and use that to distinguish them??? at the very least, we should ensure that the primary key (id) is unique across Project and Task.

Conclusion: a Project is a Task with more metadata that is not needed for tracking time. In the context of time tracking, a Task is a leaf node that contains only time entries (work).

## Stakeholders

Stakeholders can be associated with a Project in the following ways:
* responsible—one or more people who do the work
* accountable—exactly one person who "owns" the project and decides when it is done, when it has met its chartered goals.
* consulted—zero or more people who contribute as subject matter experts and support the responsible/accountable persons
* informed—zero or more people who may be interested in the progress and outcome but do not influence it directly.

## People
A person is a user of the system. The system needs to know their name, email address, phone number, and avatar.
