title: Project Charter
description: What is the project? What are the goals? What are the constraints? Who cares?
---

I will create a tool that will help me track the time I spend on projects.
There are many tools that do this, but I want to build my own.
* I want to learn and practice
* I want to build a Solo Project for Chingu voyage application


## Deliverables
* A web app that allows me to track the time I spend on projects
* A dashboard that shows me my time spent on projects
* A Chrome extension that records browser activity (optional)
* PM artifacts
* Documentation


## What is the project?
I will create a tool that will help me track the time I spend on projects.
There are many tools that do this, but I want to build my own.
* I want to learn and practice
* I want to build a Solo Project for Chingu voyage application


## What are the goals?

* Create a useful tool that will serve my needs for many years to come.
* Learn and practice web development
* Practice Project Management processes

## What are the constraints?

I must be able to finish the project in 20 hours or less.

It must be a Solo Project for the Chingu voyage application, and must meet the criteria for a Tier 3 project:
* Must include distinct files which separate the FE and BE application logic in a way the follows the Separation of Responsibility Principle (SRP).
* If the app accesses a database it must be accessed only from the BE logic. Applications that access databases from FE logic will not be accepted.
* The BE logic must implement an app-specific API that is only implemented in the BE. The FE must access the BE API to deliver services to the end user.
* Applications that use technology like Firebase only for authentication are not acceptable. Apps which couple this form of authentication with application specific API are acceptable.
* The FE logic must include logic developed by the Chingu that operates on the data to transform it, change it, or present it to the end user
* It must implement a front-end application that accesses a back-end server that implements an API of your own design, optionally using a database such as a NoSQL DBMS like MongoDB or a SQL DBMS like PostgreSQL.
* Your backend must include CRUD (if using a database) or POST/READ/UPDATE/DELETE (for APIs).


## Stakeholders

* Me: The user, project owner, product owner, developer, tester, etc. (RAC)
* Chingu: The organization that is encouraging me to build this project. (CI)
* potential users: people who will use the tool to track their time. This may include teammates of future projects/voyages.
